# Mullog

Mullog is a personal wiki powered by [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum).

Mullog takes the default Gollum server and...

- Throws it behind Puma
- Hooks it up with a remote git repo of your choosing
- Puts it all behind HTTP authentication

If you're looking for a personal deployment of Gollum to manage your life, Mullog is probably what you're looking for.

## Setup

1. Pick a git repo you want to use with Gollum
2. Create a new GitHub webhook on that repo for push events, sending a POST request to `/gh_webhook` with the content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Generate and write down a secure secret to verify webhook requests with. You'll need this when setting up your environment variables.

Then set the following environment variables:

- `GIT_URL` - HTTP(S) URL to your chosen git repo (must be HTTP(S), SSH and others are untested and may not work)
- `GIT_USERNAME` - username to authenticate to `GIT_URL` with
- `GIT_PASSWORD` - password to authenticate to `GIT_URL` with (I recommend using a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/))
- `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` - name to add to git commits (ex. "Zach Latta")
- `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` - email to add to git commits (ex. "zach@zachlatta.com")
- `HTTP_USERNAME` - username to allow HTTP login with
- `HTTP_PASSWORD` - password to allow HTTP login with
- `GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - the secret you gave when setting up your GitHub webhook
- `RACK_ENV` - can either be "production" or "development", your call

And deploy it the same way you deploy any other Rack app!
